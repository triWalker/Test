I think the compiler is finished, structure-wise. I did not test it on each of the sample tests, so I'm unsure if I might have forgotten to add something. 
It did pass the few tests I did run though. However, the resulting tvi codes may not be perfect.

Implementing error recovery features is still left to be done.
